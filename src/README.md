# Recurio

## Idea

> A tracker of recurring payments/subscriptions? Nowadays almost every service wants you to pay in a subscription model. It is super easy to forger that you're actually paying for something you don't use. The user would create a record for what they're paying and what amount. They could get some kind of notification about upcoming payment or option to remind them to cancel subscription on specific date.
> It could track the the price change, create some stats of how much money the user spends on recurring subscriptions, maybe even option to mark subscription as split between flatmates?

## Name

"Recurio" is a fusion of "recurring" and "curio" (short for "curiosity"). This name implies a service that explores and manages recurring payments with curiosity, helping users stay informed about their financial commitments.
